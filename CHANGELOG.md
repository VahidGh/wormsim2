## [0.1.0-dev] - 2026-06-15 *(current)*

### Added

- **Scientific charter** (`docs/research/00-motivation-objectives-related-work.md`) —
  motivation, related-work survey (Sibernetic, MetaWorm/BAAIWorm, prior wormuse work,
  ElegansBot), gap analysis, the proposed four-layer GPU-first closed-loop architecture
  with a web-friendly output layer, three-level validation strategy, and explicit
  objectives (G1–G7), engineering objectives (E1–E6), domain assumptions (DA1–DA5),
  and non-goals (N1–N4). Includes GPU runtime estimates and the c302/NEURON GPU
  bottleneck analysis.
- **Issue tracker** (`docs/ISSUES.md`) — `ISSUE-NNN` tracker for bugs, improvements,
  research questions, and design decisions. Seeded with 9 open items and 1 resolved
  (ISSUE-001: backend-agnostic compute core — CPU/OpenMP reference + CUDA deploy +
  optional OpenCL).
- **Requirements analysis** (`docs/requirements/01-requirements-analysis.md`) —
  stakeholders/actors, world–machine model, domain assumptions (DA1–DA5), functional
  requirements (FR-SIM, FR-COMPUTE, FR-OUT, FR-VALID, FR-DEPLOY), non-functional
  requirements (performance, portability, reproducibility, maintainability, scalability,
  web usability), five use cases (UC-01–UC-05), and G1–G7 + E2/E4 traceability matrix.
- **Architecture design** (`docs/design/02-architecture-design.md`) —
  multi-view architecture (Component & Connector, Module, Deployment); 14 components
  including ChannelLoader (NMODL `.mod` parsing) and ProprioceptiveFeedback;
  backend-agnostic `ComputeBackend` kernel interface sketch; 10 architectural
  verification gates (VR-01–VR-10); six design principles; open design issues mapped.
- **Charter update** (§2.1) — "Runtime estimates" header clarified (removed arrow
  notation); added "NEURON `.mod` files as channel-kinetics data source" paragraph
  (NCA/KA/KD/KQS/KVS/IR channels; c302 `.mod` as parameter source for GPU-HH solver;
  ISSUE-009); §4.1 updated to reference `.mod` sources.
- **ISSUE-009 refined** — now specifies `.mod` file reuse strategy in detail.
- **Project scaffold** — `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `.gitignore`, and the `src/` / `docs/` / `config/` directory skeleton.
